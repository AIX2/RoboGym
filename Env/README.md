# RoboGym-Environment

This folder contains the source code for the generating environment for RoboGym project. This source code is built on top of  [Animal-AI Environment](https://github.com/beyretb/AnimalAI-Environment) 
and [Unity ML-Agents Plugin](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents). If you are new to Unity and ML-Agents, you can find their documentation [here](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/tree/master/docs)

The project contains all the assets needed to build the executable environment used for training and evaluation. Most of the 
original code from Unity has been left unchanged, we added some parts and modified some others. Almost all of the 
RoboGym-specific code is located in `Assets/RoboGymEnvironment/TrainEnv/`.
